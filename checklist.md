# Ð¡heck Your Code Against the Following Points

## Don`t Repeat Yourself

1. Create functions when needed:

Good example:

```python
def check_temperature(temperature):
    if temperature <= 10:
        temperature = 10

    return temperature

morning_temprature = 9
evening_temperature = 22

check_temperature(morning_temprature)
check_temperature(evening_temperature)
```

Bad example:

```python
morning_temprature = 9
evening_temperature = 22

if morning_temprature <= 10:
    morning_temprature = 10

if evening_temperature <= 10:
    evening_temperature = 10
```

2. Use for loops:

Good example:

```python
home_chores = {
    "cleaning": "not done",
    "ironing_shirts": "not done"
}

to_do_list = ["cleaning", "ironing_shirts"]

for home_chore in to_do_list:
    if home_chore in home_chores:
        home_chores[home_chore] = "done"
```

Bad example:

```python
home_chores = {
    "cleaning": "not done",
    "ironing_shirts": "not done"
}

if "cleaning" in home_chores:
    home_chores["cleaning"] = "done"
    
if "ironing_shirts" in home_chores:
    home_chores["ironing_shirts"] = "done"
```

3. DRY while creating class instances:

Good example:

```python
citizens = {"names": ["Dima", "Dania"], "surnames": ["Smith", "Green"]}

citizens_list = []


class Citizen:
    def __init__(self, name: str, surname: str):
        self.name = name
        self.surname = surname


for i in range(len(citizens)):
    citizens_list.append(Citizen(name=citizens["names"][i], surname=citizens["surnames"][i]))
```

Bad example:

```python
citizens = {"names": ["Dima", "Dania"], "surnames": ["Smith", "Green"]}
citizens_list = []


class Citizen:
    def __init__(self, name: str, surname: str):
        self.name = name
        self.surname = surname


citizens_list.append(Citizen(name=citizens["names"][0], surname=citizens["surnames"][0]))
citizens_list.append(Citizen(name=citizens["names"][1], surname=citizens["surnames"][1]))
```

## Code Style

1. Make sure you use the double quotes everywhere.
2. Use descriptive and correct variable names:

Good example:

```python
def get_full_name(first_name: str, last_name: str):
    return f"{first_name} {last_name}"
```

Bad example:

```python
def get_full_name(x: str, y: str):
    return f"{x} {y}"
```

3. Use annotation, it is a good practice:

Good example:

```python
def multiply_by_2(number: int):
    return number * 2
```

Bad example:

```python
def multiply_by_2(number):
    return number * 2
```

4. Use `snake_case`:

Good example:

```python
knights_preparation = "we are preparing"
```

Bad example:

```python
knightsPreparation = "we are preparing"
```

5. Separate your code into different modules and/or packages. 
It is a good idea when you are working with a big project.

## Clean Code

Add comments, prints, and functions to check your solution when you write your code. 
Don't forget to delete them when you are ready to commit and push your code.
